Turn #1 - Prompt
I am a very visual and organized person. Recently, I read a book about habit formation, which gave me an idea. I would like to have a website for desktop browsers to help me visualize habit formation. Users should be able to visualize neural network-style connections between their routines. I would need an interactive node graph displaying the habit relationships, strength indicators based on streak duration, animations showing some habit chain reactions, and a daily commitment counter with momentum visualization. I would like to use WebGL particles to build dynamic background effects. This website should have a minimalistic and dark mode design, have a blue eclipse color palette with midnight blue tones, and use TailwindCSS to implement the styling. I would like the response to be a single, self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JS.
